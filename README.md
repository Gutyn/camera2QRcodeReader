# camera2QRcodeReader
Simple to use, real time QR code reader implementation for Android using camera2 API.
Should give you an idea on how to use the new camera2 API for applications that run on Lollipop (android 21) and up using the ImageReader's surface target. The camera streams the data through and we check for a QR code in the image in real time.
Hopefully this can be helpful for some people.<br>
NOTE: it is an experimental project and you should definitely use it as an inspiration ONLY and feel free to improve it and make pull requests.
</br> Would appreciate any advices or comments.
